1. Create an m x n matrix with replicate(m, rnorm(n)) with m=10 column vectors of n=10 elements each,
constructed with rnorm(n), which creates random normal numbers.
Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables) and perform an algebraic
operation on each element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element referred by the two
indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of creating
the solution and report the system time differences.
Ans:
 # This is a bad loop with 'growing' data

set.seed(42)

m=10

n=10


# Create matrix of normal random numbers

mymat <- replicate(m, rnorm(n))


# Transform into data frame

mydframe <- data.frame(mymat)


for (i in 1:m) 
{

  for (j in 1:n) 
{

    mydframe[i,j]<-mydframe[i,j] + 10*sin(0.75*pi)
   
     print(mydframe)
  
 }

 }

vectorization solution:
set.seed(42)

m=10

n=10

mymat <- replicate(m, rnorm(n))
 
mydframe <- data.frame(mymat)

mydframe <- mydframe + 10*sin(0.75*pi)

mydframe
